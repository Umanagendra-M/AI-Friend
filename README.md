#AI accoutability partner

This is an attempt to create a LLM based rubber duck that speaks to you and listens to your problems.


# 🧠 AI-Partner: Your Personal Rubber Duck (LLM-Based Thought Partner)

> Talk out loud. Get clarity. Make better decisions.

**AI-Partner** is a voice-activated personal assistant built with an LLM (via Ollama) that helps you **plan your day, clarify thoughts, or debug ideas** — just like a smart version of the classic *rubber duck* technique.

This project is designed to be:
- 🗣️ **Conversational** – Talk to it like you would to a teammate.
- 🧠 **Introspective** – Get feedback, reflection, and better clarity.
- 🧩 **Modular & Hackable** – Build your own features on top of it.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎙️ **Voice-to-LLM pipeline** using [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) for speech-to-text.
- 🧠 **Local LLM via Ollama** – fast, private, and customizable.
- 🔄 **Looping conversations** for deep reflection.
- 🐳 **Dockerized** for easy local setup.
